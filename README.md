# NRCAN â€“ VIARAIL COMPUTER VISION PROJECT

BIO
 
Hello, my name is Sanyami Shah. Currently, I am in my final year of MSCS. I did my bachelor's in Computer Science from India and then had 2 years of industry experience as a Big Data Analyst where I worked on the various Hadoop ecosystem and data visualization tools like Tableau. I also did a co-op in a Vancouver-based AI company called Think Technologies for 8 months as Data Science Intern. I am fond of playing around with data and observing them to extract some useful insight.

ABSTRACT
 
Every object which is used frequently requires proper maintenance and suspection to increase its life span. Via Rail operates over 500 trains per week across several Canadian provinces and 12,500 kilometres (7,800 mi) of the track. Observing them from the air is a powerful way to monitor them. The images of the railway track are captured from various distances in a different location. The aim of the project is to identify various points of interest like is Vegetation, missing ties, broken ties present on or near the railway track. The methodology involves training the algorithm such that it identifies these points of interest. After training the algorithm it turns out that there are various factors that affect the accuracy of the algorithm, and this project tries to answer these research questions.
